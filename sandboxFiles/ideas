1. Add a githooks file and configure projects to use the githooks setup generated
  - This could include making sure the commit message is a certain length
  - We could maybe find a way to not allow a push to master (we only merge into master) adding this to the githooks.

2. Perhaps we could add an ESLint tool to the project set-up as well.
